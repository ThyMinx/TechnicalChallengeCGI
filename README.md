Project creates a console application which, when run, outputs a list of customers along with a list of the products they have bought (if any). The trouble is, this project is currently very slow (it may take 1 minute or longer, so please be patient), as can be evidenced by running the application and viewing the ‘time taken’ message. You must speed up this code so it is at least 4 times faster. However, the following restrictions apply:  You may ONLY edit DataStore.cs --- All code you write must be thread safe --- Assume that the underlying data can change at any time. However, this will always be as a result of a call to BaseDataStore.Save. --- You may not copy and paste the code the data initialisation code in BaseDataStore.cs. In other words, you must call the base methods somewhere in your code.  In addition, the less code you write, the better.  When you are finished, either paste the contents of your DataStore.cs file below, or attach it to your answer.
